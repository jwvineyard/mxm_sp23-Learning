# Integrating local learning into the two-stage Markov task to separate model-based from model-free learning

Authors: Peizhe Li, Jimmy Vineyard, Seungyeon Oh, Jack Maloney, Amy Cochran, and Haley Colgate Kottler

For convenience, the simulation code for our adaptation of the two-stage Markov task that incorporates local learning is provided both as a Python script in "LoCA_2stage.py", and as a Jupyter Notebook in "LoCA_2stage.ipynb".

## Requirements

- matplotlib 3.8.0
- numpy 1.26.4
